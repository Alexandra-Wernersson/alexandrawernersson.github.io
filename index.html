						<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>I am a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science.
Before coming to NYU, I completed a PhD thesis on <a href="#two">magnetar bursts</a> with 
Anna Watts and Michiel van der Klis at the 
<a href="http://www.astro.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy</a> of the University of Amsterdam.
Previously, I studied at the University of Amsterdam and Jacobs University Bremen, where I completed an undergraduate
degree in Geosciences and Astrophysics. </br>

						<h2>(X-ray) Astronomy and Data Science</h2>

At the moment, I am particularly interested in the application of statistical methods and machine learning in astronomy, 
especially in time series data taken with X-ray and gamma-ray satellites. At these wavelengths, one can look at some of the most energetic
and violent events in the universe:
black holes accreting gas from an orbiting star, highly magnetized neutron stars undergo 
catastrophic outbursts of energy that shake the whole star, and massive stellar explosions that are the brightest events 
in the universe. 
There is one thing all these phenomena have in common: they are transient, that is, their brightness varies 
with time, sometimes by a factor of a hundred or a thousand. Studying in detail how they vary with time can help us understand 
the physical processes that produced the variability in the first place.

 My interest is in developing and applying methods for 
this purpose to help us get the most information out of the data we gather.

                                                <h2>Magnetar Research</h2>
                                        </header>
                                        
<p>
For my PhD thesis, the main focus of my research rested on magnetars. These are neutron stars--the ultra-dense remnants of 
some types of stellar explosion (supernova)--that have exceptionally strong magnetic fields: about fourteen orders of magnitude 
stronger than that of the Earth! Neutron stars are one of the prime target for studying nuclear physics at densities and pressures 
that we cannot produce on Earth. Similarly, because their magnetic fields are far stronger than anything reproducible in a laboratory, 
we can use them to study unique quantum field effects only believed to be in effect in fields this strong. </p>

<p>
In practice, I studied bursts and flares from magnetars. Once in a while, we see bright blips of hard X-ray light that only last 
for a fraction of a second. Over the years, we have gathered thousands of such blips (called recurrent bursts) from several of 
these magnetars. Very, very rarely, they also show extremely bright outbursts in X-rays called giant flares. These are so bright 
that they can swamp our X-ray telescopes with light, and the gamma-ray photons of one of them even caused a measurable depression 
in Earth's magnetic field! These giant flares are a treasure trove for studying neutron stars and dense matter physics, because 
during the course of a flare, we have seen the brightness vary in periodic patterns. These patterns are so telling that we believe 
they've been caused by star quakes: effectively, the entire solid crust (neutron stars have solid crystal crusts, unlike normal 
stars) twists and shakes, something we can measure in the light that we see. In the same way that geoscientists study the earth's 
interior by measuring the waves travelling through it during an earthquake, we hope to be able to study the interior of neutron 
stars by studying the waves during a star quake. </p>

<p>While we have measured these waves in giant flares, these flares are rare, 
so data is scarce. My main task during my PhD was to search for these waves in the much shorter recurrent bursts. This task 
is technically challenging, because the methods we have for finding them were not designed for that particular task. Here is 
a simple comparison: imagine standing at a still pond. When you throw in a stone, you will see the ripples the stone created 
in the surface. Now imagine standing at the bow of a ship during a storm, performing the same experiment. 
The sea will be churning, there will be large waves and peaks and troughs, and that will make seeing the ripples created 
by the stone much more difficult. Our methods were designed largely for situations analogous to the still pond. The magnetar 
bursts I am studying, however, are more like a stormy sea! Most of my PhD research was dedicated to making our methods work 
(or, in my case, use a new method!) in the latter case, which can not only be applied to magnetars, but to other bright bursts 
as well (for example gamma-ray bursts or solar flares). We did find waves in the shorter bursts in the end, which gives us 
more data points to constrain theoretical models. Besides, we are still working to make those methods better, and we have 
not finished the search yet, so there may be more to come in the future!
